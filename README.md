WooCommerce only sends the booking confirmation email when admin approval is required and the admin approves the order, thus changing its status to "Confirmed"

When admin approval is not required on a booking product, the order never reaches the 'Confirmed' status, instead going directly to status 'Paid', and therefore it never sends the booking confirmation email.

This plugin changes that behaviour such that upon order completion, the booking is changed to the 'Confirmed' status, thus sending the booking confirmation email.
